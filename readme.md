### 6. Answer the following questions clearly:

2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?
3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?


Ans(1): 

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

getElementById: Is a DOM method used to select an element using id.
It returns us a single element...

getElementsByClassName: It is used to select more than one item using class name. We can use loop to access the elements. Works 
like an array or object...

querySelector: It is used to get the element using css selectors which can be id, class, tags etc. Gets the first element that matches with the selectors...

querySelectorAll: Gets all elements that matches the selector. Works like querySelector but it can access multiple values. We can use loops to traverse and get the elements..

2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?

Ans(2): We can use three steps to create and insert a new element into a DOM

-- first, Create the Element : document.createElement()
-- second, insert attributes to the element by .innerText, innerHTML
-- Then Append : appendChild()

3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?

Ans(3): When you click or interact with an event, the event does not stay in one place it can bubble its way to its parents and ultimately the roots. Basically, it works like a tree. Every element is connected to each other...

<div id="parent" style="">
  Parent
  <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", (){
  console.log("Child button clicked!");
});

document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", (){
  console.log("Parent div clicked!");
});

document.body.addEventListener("click", (){
  console.log("Body clicked!");
});

4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Ans(4): Is a Js process where, we can use the common parent of multiple child elements to handle events. We can use a common event listener for a parent instead of adding multiple event listener to children...

<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

document.getElementById("menu").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {   // ensure it's an <li>
    console.log("You clicked:", event.target.innerText);
  }
});

we can add one single event listener to menu as it works as a parent to the list items..

5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?

stopPropagation():

Stops the event from bubbling to parent elements.

It doesn‚Äôt stop the element‚Äôs default behavior, only the event flow from child to the parents...

preventDefault()--

It stops the default behavior of an element. For example, we can stop the <form> to submit or load
